This project is part of Module 10 Challenge of Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

## Project Description
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. 

### Files supplied
Hawaii sqlite database that contains two tables, measurements table has the weather station, temperature and precipitation data of Hawaii and the stations table has all the station details of the stations listed in the measurements table.  

The tables in the sqlite database are also supplied as csv files.  

#### Deliverables
1. Explore climate data by conducting a precipitation and station analysis; plot a bar chart of the precipitation in mm in Hawaii over the last 12 months and a histogram of the previous 12 months of temperature observations. 
2. Design a climate API that consists of static routes and dynamic routes.
